<h4>The Climate Academy</h4>
<p>The Climate Academy is an organisation created by founders Matthew Pye, Geert Bukkems, and the co-founder Nicolas Duquenne in 2011. The Academy has organised seminars, workshops and activities all around Europe. They strive to start important discussions and educate people on the climate crisis, as well as fight for climate action. They have worked on various projects such as Movies for Change and The Writing’s on the Wall - a mural painted on one of our school’s walls raising awareness on the issue of the climate crisis and encouraging pupils and staff to cut emissions by 11%. Students of the Climate Academy have the chance to work together to participate in environmental projects and become ambassadors to spread their knowledge across countries. The Climate Academy Student Textbook is being worked on and will soon be released. The Climate Academy has made the initiative to empower and educate young people to inspire them to take action on climate change.</p>

<h4>Vanessa Nakate</h4>
<p>A 25 year old woman who gained attention in 2019 when she protested outside the Ugandan parliament, taking inspiration from Greta Thunberg. In 2020 she was cropped out of a media photo, while Greta Thunberg, Luisa Neubauer and other white activists were not. This slight increased her popularity even further. In the last few years she has written the book A Bigger Picture, launched the Rise Up movement to help African activist voices to be heard, and, in 2022, become a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.</p>

<h4>Rahmina Paulette</h4>
<p>She became aware of climate change and started advocating against it at the age of 5. She has gained a lot of popularity in recent years as a climate activist. She has launched the Let Lake Victoria Breathe Again campaign, which aims to help Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa, preserve its precious ecosystem. Currently the lake is being overtaken by pollution and water hyacinths. The campaign takes these invasive plants and uses them to create bags, coasters, furniture and other everyday objects.</p>

Currently, along with Solal Moisan, she creates films and performs on stage; both initiatives were started to raise awareness about climate change. On the 28th of May, 2020, the duo released a film “Réveillons-nous”, which quickly went viral and helped Camille gain attention. She took a gap year from studying to focus on her activism and since then has debated with many politicians, given talks, and educated people on necessary actions. </p>
