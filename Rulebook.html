	<h3>Which viruses caused most damage?</h3>
  <p>The following websites are just a few of the worst viruses ever made. They all have caused enormous damage, sometimes the value of it is in billions of dollars.</p>

  <h4>ILOVEYOU</h4>
  <p>ILOVEYOU, also known as Loveletter, is virus created during early 2000's by Philippines student Onel de Guzman.</p>
  <p>The virus consisted of a "love letter" sent to to email adresses. It would then make copies of itself to every email adress in the infeced machine's contact list. It has been said that it spread to more than 10 percent of the world's total number of PC's. The damage is estimated to be about 15 billion dollars.</p>

  <h4>Code Red</h4>
  <p>This 2001 virus penetrated about 957 000 hosts. The main target were Microsoft IIS users.</p>
  <p>After infection, the virus would duplicate and spread itself, taking up computer ressources. It will then launch a denial of service attack on several IP address, famous among them was the attack on the White House website . It also allows backdoor access to the server, allowing for remote access to the machine.</p>
  <p>The virus would leave behind a message:"Hacked By Chinese"</p>

  <h4>Sasser</h4>
  <p>In 2004, Sven Jaschan created the virus Sasser. It would take advantage of a exploit in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Services.</p>
  <p>The virus did major damage (estimated around 500 million dollars), but pretty simply: it would crash and slow down computers.</p>

  <h4>Zeus</h4>
  <p>In 2009, Zeus targeted windows computers to use them to perform criminal acts. It infected targets through phishing scams or downloads.</p>
  <p>The virus compromised thousand of FTP accounts and computers from large multinational corporations and banks. A notable example is Amazon!</p>
  <p>Zeus managed to steal 70 million dollars and the damage is estimated to be around 3 billions.</p>

  <h4>Mydoom</h4>
  <p>This virus became one of the fastest spreading email viru since ILOVEYOU!</p>
  <p>The worm spreads itself by appearing as an email transmission error and contains an attachment of itself. Once executed, it will send itself to email addresses that are in a user’s address book and copies itself to any P2P program’s folder to propagate itself through that network.</p>
  <p>T this day, Mydoom is considered as one of the most dammaging viruses of all time. 38,5 billion dollars are the estimated value of the damages.</p>
  <p>This virus exists in some form still today...</p>

  <h4>CryptoLocker</h4>
  <p>CryptoLocker that begun in 2013 would attack computers by encrypting their files.It displayed a red ransom note informing users that “your important files encryption produced on this computer.” A payment window accompanied the note. Problem was that even after its removal, the files would still stay encrypted until the money was paid.</p>
  <p>500 000 infections are estimated to have happened. The operators behind it have gained over 3 million dollars from it.</p>

  <h4>WannaCry</h4>
  <p>This virus was developped in 2017 and would take over your computer and hold it hostage. The damage is considered to be more than 4 billion dollars.</p>
  <p>It caused massive productivity losses as businesses, hospitals, and government organizations that didn’t pay were forced to rebuild systems from scratch.</p>

  <pre>
  </pre>

  <h4>Conficker</h4>
  <p>It was developped in 2009 and infected over 9 million computers, which is completely unbelievable. It is one of the biggest infections that ever occured causing an estimate damage of 9 billion dollars.</p>
  <p>The virus would create a massive botnet army  of remotely controlled computers capable of stealing financial data and other information. It would also reset account reset settings and block access to antivirus sites and windows updates and even lock out user accounts among many..</p>
  <p>What is very peculiar about this virus is that it isn't known to this day the reason behind its creation. The army created was never used for any specific purpose.</p>

  <h4>Sobig</h4>
  <p>Altough this 2003 virus isn't that recognised amongst many, it is actually the second most damaging virus that was ever released. The estimated damage is said to be 30 billion dollars.</p>
  <p>A few versions of the virus were created (from Sobig A to Sobig F) but the most destructive one was Sobig F!</p>
  <p>The virus would spread through emails hidden as a legitimate software.</p>

  <pre>
  </pre>

  <h4>Melissa</h4>
  <p>The most dangerous computer virus in 1999, created by David L. Smith, Melissa sent copies of itself (Word documents)that were said to be full of passwords for pornographic sites.<p>
  <p>The virus reportedly caused 80 million dollars in damages.</p>

  <pre>
  </pre>

  <h4>Stuxnet</h4>
  <p>This virus is different than all the others mentionned before since this virus was created for the purpose of cyberwarfare. It was created in 2009/2010 to control Irani industrial systems. It is said that Stuxnet caused Iran's centrifuges to spin out of control and self-destruct.</p>
  <p>The virus spread through infected USB drives, aimed at Simens machinery.</p>
  <p>The virus was meant to stay only in Iran but 40% of it still affected other countries, altough not dramatically.</p>
